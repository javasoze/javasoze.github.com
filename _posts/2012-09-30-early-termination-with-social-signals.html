title: Early termination with social signals
---
<h2>Early termination</h2>
<p>
  Early termination is a common technique used in search engine development to reduce query latency on large indexes. The idea is simple, if we were order the posting-list in decreasing significances or relevance order measured by a query-independent static rank, e.g. Google's PageRank on a webpage. Then, as we process the posting list, we can break out when we have collected enough hits before finish walking the entire list.
</p>
<p>
  An important observation is that with early termination, the query latency does not grow linearly as index size grows. To return only the top N hits is very consistent with a search engine's access pattern.
</p>

	The following simple code snippet illustrates how this works:
	<pre class="prettyprint">
	    int numHitsRequested = ...
	    int numHitsCollected = ...
	    int docid = ...
	    ...
	    public int nextDoc(){
		  if (docid != NO_MORE_DOCS &amp;&amp; numHitsCollected &lt; numHitsRequested){
		    return (docid = nextHit());	
		  }
		  else{
		    return (docid = NO_MORE_DOCS);
		  }
	    }
	</pre>
