title: Next Play - Leaving LinkedIn
---
<h2>LinkedIn...</h2>
<p>
About five years ago, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/reidhoffman" target="_new">Reid Hoffman</a> told me his visions of his social network startup - <a href="http://www.linkedin.com" target="_new">LinkedIn</a> being a massive company, connecting people with opportunity. Today, Reid's vision has been realized: LinkedIn is listed on NYSE with one of the most successful IPOs, and its brand is a household name.
</p>
<p>
In the following five years, together with some of the smartest people, I enjoyed building up LinkedIn's search infrastructure which powers the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/search/fpsearch" target="_new">Search Properties (People, Jobs, Company etc.)</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/signal" target="_new">Signal</a>, the homepage, and <a href="http://senseidb.com" target="_new">SenseiDB</a>. 	I am very happy that my work has brought value to millions of users, and a lot of it was contributed back to the open source community.
</p>
<p>
I am extremely grateful to Reid and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jvaillant" target="_new">Jean-Luc</a> for letting me be part of the LinkedIn story.
</p>

<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>
  The reason for my transition to Twitter from LinkedIn would be better explained by "why going to Twitter" than "why leaving LinkedIn". 
</p>
<h4>Problem-set</h4>
<p>
	My interest has always been realtime and semi-structured search systems.  I feel the web is becoming more structured and more realtime.
</p>
<p>
	There is only a handful of companies in the world that serve billions of queries per day on top of hundreds of billions of documents. Amongst them, only one company can say: the world is real-time, and our corpus is expanding at 400 million documents a day (and growing, fast...)! So, when I learned Twitter is building the next generation search infrastructure, the opportunity is too big not to pursue.
</p>

<h4>Culture:</h4>
<p>
<a href="http://twitter.github.com/" target="_new">Twitter's open source repertoire</a> with 77 projects with 155 participants. The open source culture drives passion and innovation, and feeds into Twitter's fast paced hacker culture. For me, I have especially been interested in the work Twitter has done on realtime search extensions to Lucene. To be able to help further the contribution is super exciting to me. 
</p>

<h2>Next play</h2>
<p>
	I am of course a bit sad leaving a company that I love, and colleagues that became family. At the same time I am excited by the new challenges at Twitter, looking forward to making new friends and making Twitter search magical.
